# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

## Overview
This repository documents my independent project for the Google Data Analytics Capstone on Coursera. The analysis is based on the Cyclistic bike-share case study, which uses real-world data from a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. My goal is to answer three business questions using the data analysis process.
---

## Business Questions
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
---

## Data Source
- Publicly available trip data provided for the Google Data Analytics Capstone (CSV format, 12 months).
- Key columns: `ride_id`, `rideable_type`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`, `member_casual`, etc.
---

## Analysis Process
### 1. Ask
- Defined the business questions above, based on the case study instructions.

### 2. Prepare
- Downloaded and reviewed the Cyclistic bike-share trip data.
- Checked the data for completeness and format issues.

### 3. Process
- Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and rows with missing values.
- Standardized date and member type columns.
- Calculated ride duration and extracted day of week for each trip.

### 4. Analyze
- Used spreadsheet tools (Excel/Google Sheets) to summarize and compare ride patterns by user type.
- Explored ride counts, average durations, and usage by day of week and station.

### 5. Share
- Created charts and tables to visualize differences in usage.
- Documented findings and included visualizations in this repository.

### 6. Act
- Summarized insights and provided recommendations related to the three business questions.

## Findings
### 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- The data shows differences in ride frequency, duration, and timing between annual members and casual riders.
- (Insert your actual findings here, such as: "Annual members tend to take shorter, more frequent rides on weekdays, while casual riders take longer rides, often on weekends.")

### 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- Based on the data and case study context, potential reasons include cost savings for frequent riders, convenience, and possible member benefits.
- (Insert your analysis here, such as: "Casual riders who ride often could save money with a membership. Highlighting these savings could encourage conversion.")

### 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
- Digital media strategies could include targeted emails, app notifications, and social media campaigns focused on the benefits of membership.
- (Insert your ideas here, such as: "Sending personalized emails to casual riders after a certain number of rides, or promoting membership benefits on social media.")
